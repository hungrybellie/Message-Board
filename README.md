# Message Board 💬👩🏻‍💻
Hello! Welcome to my C4C technical application! :)

# How to open 📂
To see what I've prepared for you, please clone the repository and open in an environment such as VSCode. Here you will be able to see my code, and also by copying the path for the "login.html" file and pasting into a browser, you will be able to view and interact with the project.

# Features 🪄

Unfortunately, due to many final assignments that were due in this same week, I could not meet the last requirement of the MVP. However, I have implemented a few extra pieces of flourish that I hope will make up for that!

- To mimic the last requirement I made use of local storage to make messages that you post persistent. So, even if you refresh or close the page, the messages you posted will still be there.
- I utilized a warm, neutral color pallete, along with a cute, cozy design. I intended for this to create a safe environment for users to feel comfortable with posting.
- The login screen is static, however if you press the "go!" button, you will be able to get to the message board screen.
- The password text input allows sensitive information to stay private.
- The messages appear on the board in order of most recent to least recent.
- Text inputs get darker when pressed to help with accessibility.
- Messages cannot be empty or over 128 words, if they are, an alert will appear.
